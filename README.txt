===========
Assimp-Test
===========


This is a quick test for using the Assimp library with Unity3D.

Based on assimp-net, which is partly copied into Assets/AssimpNet/
with no changes, but with the outer layer removed.

The DLL in Assets/StreamingAssets/ comes from Appimp 4.1.0.  The C# sources
are older; I had to fix one detail and I hope there isn't any hidden ones.
The plan is to eventually update this code to Assimp 5, which is in available
as source-only release candidate as of May 2019.
