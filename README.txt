Assimp-Test
===========


This is a quick test for using the Assimp library with Unity3D.
https://github.com/assimp/assimp


Based on assimp-net, which is partly copied into Assets/AssimpNet/
with no changes, but with the outer layer removed.

This is based on the older Assimp 3.3.1 because assimp-net was not
updated, but the plan is to eventually update this code to Assimp 4.1 or 5.
